# Fake-News-Detection
Fake News Detection System which uses RoBERTa for classification and facilitated explainability with LIME and SHAP.



Contains static, template for front end... and app.py too

conf paper doc, ppt, documentation has also been uploaded as record in future

open that ipynb file.. download it, upload the dataset to a colab and run each cell and everything is good to go... but if u want to see output in UI, just download the app.py file which contains flask code, along with static and templates, change the path inside each if needed. Double click app.py file and a local server link appears. Open it and it will take u to the UI, u can play with some texts and u will see prediction and explainations of lime and shap too

u can save our trained model and can also use it to predict the texts but the model is still not performing well. so ive addded a pretrained model named cyberlord etc etc and the project used it for prediction

its just a singlle line, even in colab that is used for prediction and also in UI its used for prediction. we didnt use our model, we just trained it with our dataset, but predictions are made using a pretrained model that cyberlord etc etc. idk the full propername but u can find it in code!!!
